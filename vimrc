" set the runtime path to include Vundle and initialize
set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
call vundle#begin()
	source ~/.vim/plugins.vim
call vundle#end()            " required
filetype plugin indent on    " required

" ================ General Config ====================
set tabstop=4       " The width of a TAB is set to 4.
                  " Still it is a \t. It is just that
                  " Vim will interpret it to be having
                  " a width of 4.
set shiftwidth=4    " Indents will have a width of 4
set softtabstop=4   " Sets the number of columns for a TAB
set expandtab       " Expand TABs to spaces

set number                      "Line numbers are good
set relativenumber              "Line numbers are good
set backspace=indent,eol,start  "Allow backspace in insert mode
set history=1000                "Store lots of :cmdline history
set showcmd                     "Show incomplete cmds down the bottom

" FINDING FILES:

set path+=**			" Search down into subfolders
				" Provides tab-completion for all file-related tasks

set wildmenu			" Display all matching files when we tab complete

" NOW WE CAN:
" - Hit tab to :find by partial match
" - Use * to make it fuzzy

" THINGS TO CONSIDER:
" - :b lets you autocomplete any open buffer


" TAG JUMPING:

" Create the `tags` file (may need to install ctags first)
command! MakeTags !ctags -R .

" NOW WE CAN:
" - Use ^] to jump to tag under cursor
" - Use g^] for ambiguous tags
" - Use ^t to jump back up the tag stack

" THINGS TO CONSIDER:
" - This doesn't help if you want a visual list of tags





" AUTOCOMPLETE:

" The good stuff is documented in |ins-completion|

" HIGHLIGHTS:
" - ^x^n for JUST this file
" - ^x^f for filenames (works with our path trick!)
" - ^x^] for tags only
" - ^n for anything specified by the 'complete' option

" NOW WE CAN:
" - Use ^n and ^p to go back and forth in the suggestion list





" FILE BROWSING:

" Tweaks for browsing
let g:netrw_banner=0        " disable annoying banner
let g:netrw_browse_split=4  " open in prior window
let g:netrw_altv=1          " open splits to the right
let g:netrw_liststyle=3     " tree view
let g:netrw_list_hide=netrw_gitignore#Hide()
let g:netrw_list_hide.=',\(^\|\s\s\)\zs\.\S\+'

" NOW WE CAN:
" - :edit a folder to open a file browser
" - <CR>/v/t to open in an h-split/v-split/tab
" - check |netrw-browse-maps| for more mappings



" SNIPPETS:

" Read an empty HTML template and move cursor to title
" nnoremap ,html :-1read $HOME/.vim/.skeleton.html<CR>3jwf>a
" nnoremap ,html :-1read /Users/samuel/.yadr/vim/snippets<CR>3jwf>a

" NOW WE CAN:
" - Take over the world!
"   (with much fewer keystrokes)









" BUILD INTEGRATION:

" Steal Mr. Bradley's formatter & add it to our spec_helper
" http://philipbradley.net/rspec-into-vim-with-quickfix

" Configure the `make` command to run RSpec
set makeprg=bundle\ exec\ rspec\ -f\ QuickfixFormatter

" NOW WE CAN:
" - Run :make to run RSpec
" - :cl to list errors
" - :cc# to jump to error by number
" - :cn and :cp to navigate forward and back
